# 06 Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler
In this project I have created a weather dashboard. Weather is an important consideration when planning a trip. The dashboard allows you to see the current temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index for a city. The dashboard also allows you to see an extended 5 day forecast that shows temperature, wind, and humidity for a city.
